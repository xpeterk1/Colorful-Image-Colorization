# Colorful Image Colorization

The goal of the project is to train a DNN model capable of transforming a grayscale image into a color one. Results can look somehow artistic but have to have realistic color.

Complete solution with logs from training is in the file *Colorization.ipynb*.

This model was trained on a subset of the Imagenet database called TinyImagenet (https://www.kaggle.com/c/tiny-imagenet).

## Credits

This is an implementation of a paper presented by Richard Zhang (https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08511).

## Examples

This list of examples demonstates capabilities of the neural network. These inputs were not cherry-picked in any way.
Expanded list of examples together with more evaluation metrics is present in the file *Colorization.ipynb*.\

The following images come in order: Input grayscale - Output predicted by the model - Ground truth
